## Project Workflow Instructions

### Knowledge Base & Context

- Always refer to knowledge base files to understand project context
- Verify information from context before presenting it
- Follow implementation plans for feature development
- After completing steps, update implementation plans with "Done" status and summary

### Code Modification Approach

- Make changes file by file to allow error detection
- Preserve existing code structures and functionalities
- Provide all edits in a single chunk per file
- Always provide links to real files, not context-generated ones
- Check context-generated files for current implementations
- Keep the codebase clean and organized

### Communication Guidelines

- No apologies in comments or documentation
- No understanding feedback in responses
- No unnecessary summaries of changes
- No whitespace change suggestions
- No invention of changes beyond what's requested
- No unnecessary confirmation requests
- No implementation verification requests for visible context

### Coding Standards

- Use explicit, descriptive variable names
- Follow consistent coding style within the project
- Prioritize performance in code changes
- Take a security-first approach
- Implement robust error handling
- Follow modular design principles
- Ensure version compatibility
- Avoid magic numbers by using named constants
- Consider and handle edge cases
- Use assertions to validate assumptions
